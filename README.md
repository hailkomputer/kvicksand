# kvicksand
Kvicksand is a playground project I use as a placeholder microservice to be deployed to various lab clusters.

Its current iteration, it includes a simple in-memory cache with a basic http rest api interface. 

A side aim is to use standard golang library as much as possible to build various components of the service, in order to experiment with code that is usually abstracted away by various 3rd party libraries.
